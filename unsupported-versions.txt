# This file contains unsupported versions of LibreOffice.
#
# Unlike our list of blacklisted versions, this list contains versions
# that we actually want to appear in the BSA, such as "3.5 all versions".
# For now, this list consists solely of EOL releases.
#
# Listing a version here will cause the BSA to trigger a user warning
# when the version is selected in the drop-down box.
#
# The versions are listed in the same order as the version drop-down,
# from Newest to Oldest.

3.5 all versions
3.4 all versions
3.3 all versions
