This is a little bit of code that reads the version of the bugzilla via XMLRPC.
We should move to the XMLRPC-interface to connect BSA with the bugzilla as that is more reliable then parsing the pages.
I used mimic to top this code on http://mimic-xmlrpc.sourceforge.net/.

API: http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/4.0/en/html/api/Bugzilla/WebService.html
